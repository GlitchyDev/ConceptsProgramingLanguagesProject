# ConceptsProgramingLanguagesProject
 
A project made for my College Programing Concepts, its goal was to Scan, Parse, and Interpret a form of basic Julia. Currently it supports a basic Julia grammer of Variable Types of Ints, Bools and Strings, Control Statements If, Else, While, and For, Statements like Assignment ( Scope ) and Printing. It also supports many operations for each data type.

This project was made with my Team of Chris Killebrew and James Martin! Thanks for the help guys!
